## Election-Audit Summary
The script that was writen for this analysis has been shown to be both effective and efficient. It could be adapted to analyse results of most elction with minor or no modifications. For instance, to be used to analyse a city or county elections, adjustments would be made to account for wards rather than counties. It is hereby recommended that the script be adopted for analysis of future elections.
